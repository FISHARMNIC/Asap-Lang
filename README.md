# Asap-Lang
A simple programming language that lets you make it as complicated as you want  
## Unique Features
* Naturally implicitly typed
  * You don't need to type anything, nor worry about changing a variables type
  * You can however, create locked typed variables
* Simplicity of python, complexion of C 
  * Strings an arrays are as easy to use as python
  * But you can make it as complicated as you want, with low-level memory manipulation
    * This means.... Pointers! 

## Where it's at
* The language is first compiled into a high-level assembly type language. This is then compiled to free-standing x86 assembly.
* Currently, the assembly language compiler is almost complete and lets you code in ASPM *(Asap Sub Programming Language)*
* Once that is complete, the compiler for ASAP will be built
